# About

A comprehensive, open-source [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension for creating boilerplate for a fullstack [SaaS application](https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Software-as-a-Service) with one simple command. [UpNext](https://upnextjs.org/) delivers all of the features needed to jumpstart your application including end to end CRUD functionality, authentication, payments/billing and more.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This is beta software, which means there may still be bugs. Please [report any bugs and share your feedback](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/UpNext/issues).

UpNext is currently only compatible with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for package management.

# Installation

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

2. Launch Visual Studio Code

3. Install our UpNext extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=UpNext.upnext)

# Configuration

- Initiate a git repository including your `README`, `.gitignore`, and `LICENSE` as we do not provide these files. Then, open your repository with Visual Studio Code.

- Launch the command palette by using `Ctrl-Shift-P` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd-Shift-P` (Mac/OSX)

- Type in and select `Create Boilerplate` from the drop down menu

</p>

- `Create Boilerplate` should create a new UpNext terminal in your VS Code and start installing all of your dependencies. Wait until installation has concluded before continuing.

- Now that you have all of your dependencies, run the `npm test` script to ensure that all of your files/directories have been successfully created. If you are missing files, run the `Create Boilerplate` command again and re-run your test script until you pass all tests.

</p>

- After all of your files/directories have been successfully created, head over to your `.env` file located in the root directory. It should look a little something like this:

</p>

- Your `.env` file houses all of the sensitive information for your [OAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/introduction) and [Stripe Payments](https://stripe.com/docs/keys). Be sure to replace our placeholder strings with your ids and secrets (do not include quotes) before attempting to test the authentication and payments page. Be sure to include your `.env` in your `.gitignore` for security purposes.

- Once you have your ids and secrets properly assigned, test our boilerplate by starting Next in development mode using `npm run dev` and in a different terminal use `npm run startdev` to start the server.

- Congratulations, you've finished configuring your UpNext boilerplate. Now focus on your business logic.
